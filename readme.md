# postselect_graphs




## files:

 - graph_data.zip
	- Contains plain-text and Mathematica representations of all graphs, delineated into entanglement classes for n = 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.
	
 - graph_tools.nb
    - Contains implementation of FindAccessibleClasses and associated functions
	- To run graph_tools.nb, extract graph_data.zip to the same directory as graph_tools.nb
	
## Instructions:
	
 - Run initialization cells
 - Scroll to FindAccesibleClasses -> Execute
 - Select a resource state 
 - Select corresponding gate topology generating function, T 
 - Run!
