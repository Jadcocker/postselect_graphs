postselect_graphs




_files:______________________

 - graph_data.zip
	- Contains plain-text and Mathematica representations of all graphs, delineated into entanglement classes for n = 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.
	
 - graph_tools.nb
    - Contains implementation of FindAccessibleClasses and associated functions
	- To run graph_tools.nb, extract graph_data.zip to the same directory as graph_tools.nb
	

	
To use graph_tools.nb, run initialization cells, scroll to FindAccesibleClasses -> Execute, select a resource state (and corresponding gate topology generating function, T) and run!
 - For 9 qubit states, initialize qubit resource loading (may take a few seconds)
